CAR PARKING ALERT
A parking sensor is a device that helps park the vehicle safely and gives you confidence while reversing. It determines object or obstacles distance by bouncing the ultrasonic/electromagnetic waves emitted by it, and then this play the calculated distance between the obstacle and the sensor. 
The parking sensor circuit's goal is to detect an object approaching it or an object approaching it, continuously measuring the distance between them with an ultrasonic distance sensor, displaying information on the screen, and emitting an audible warning, usually through the use of a buzzer, due to the shortening of the distance. As the distance between the two points decreases, the audible warning becomes more frequent. To put it another way, the proposed system has two primary functions:
• Obtaining data from a screen by measuring the distance between them
• Increased or decreased distance causes variable audible warnings.
The parking sensor detects when the automobile is being backed up using ultrasonic waves. The ultrasonic sensor on the rear bumper emits ultrasonic waves to the obstruction, which are reflected, allowing the driver to calculate the real distance between the car body and the impediment and notifying the driver to come to a halt.
When the car is in R gear, the parking sensor will engage automatically. The controller controls the ultrasonic emission through the ultrasonic sensor in the rear bumper. Obstacles reflect the ultrasonic wave, which is received by the ultrasonic sensor and sent to the amplifier circuit.
